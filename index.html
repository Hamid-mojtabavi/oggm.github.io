<h2 class="post-title">About the model</h2>

<p>
The model builds upon <a href="http://www.the-cryosphere.net/6/1295/2012/tc-6-1295-2012.html" target="_blank">Marzeion et al., (2012)</a> and intends to become a global scale, modular, and open source model for glacier dynamics. The model accounts for glacier geometry (including contributory branches) and includes a simple (yet explicit) ice dynamics module. It can simulate past and future mass-balance, volume and geometry of any glacier in a fully automated workflow. We rely exclusively on publicly available data for calibration and validation.

<p>
The project is currently in intense development. Get in touch with <a href="mailto:fabien.maussion@uibk.ac.at">us</a> if you want to contribute.

<h2 class="post-title">Motivation</h2>

<p>
<center>
<i>
"Develop a <strong>global</strong> scale, <strong>modular</strong>, and <strong>open source</strong> numerical model framework for <strong>consistently</strong> simulating past and future global scale glacier change".
</i>
</center>
</p>

<p>
 <i>Global</i> not only in the sense of leading to meaningful results for all glaciers combined, but also for any small ensemble of glaciers, e.g. at the headwater catchment scale.  <i>Modular</i> in the sense of allowing combinations of different approaches to the representation of ice flow and surface mass balance. <i>Open source</i> so that the code can be read and used by anyone and so that new modules can be added and discussed by the community, following the principles of open governance. <i>Consistent</i> in order to provide well-defined uncertainty measures at all realizable scales.
</p>

<h2 class="post-title">Mission statement</h2>

<p>
Our project is rather motivated by the far reaching goal of contributing (and helping others to contribute) to answers of some of the <strong>“big questions”</strong> in Earth Sciences:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>How much ice is stored on the glaciers on Earth?</li>
  <li>How much ice was present on Earth at the beginning of the th century, and how much ice will be lost by the end of the 21st? </li>
  <li>What are the uncertainties associated with these numbers, and where do they originate?</li> 
  <li>How much model complexity is just right?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="post-title">Vision</h2>

<p>
We envision our model as a seed that has high potential to grow into a self-sustained, community-driven global scale model for glaciers, which is so far missing from the landscape of climate model endeavors. It will push the glacier modeling community by providing a basis for more widespread and enhanced development of glacier modeling tools for regional and global applications. It will enable regional and global studies of glacier-climate interactions without the need for a self-developed tool. Furthermore, it will enable a new kind of model intercomparison, based on coupling of different mass balance and ice dynamics components.
